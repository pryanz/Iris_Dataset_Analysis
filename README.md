# ðŸŒ¸ Iris Dataset Analysis

This project explores the famous Iris dataset using Python, performing **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, data visualization, and basic **classification modeling**. It aims to uncover patterns in petal and sepal measurements and distinguish between Iris species with machine learning.


## Project Objectives

- Understand the structure and distribution of the Iris dataset
- Visualize relationships between features using plots
- Perform data preprocessing
- Apply simple classification models (like Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.)
- Evaluate and interpret model performance
